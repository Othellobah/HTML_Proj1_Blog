                <p>We live in times of polarization and fragmentation. In many places, the ties
                    that have historically bound societies together are coming apart.</p>
                <p>Our own society has been brewing a strong and growing distrust of everything
                    under the sun. We don’t trust many of our elected leaders and government
                    officials. We don’t have high confidence in our medical and health authorities.
                    We have doubts about the agendas and intentions of large corporations. Our
                    suspicions about media and news outlets have reached new heights. We have been
                    let down by our educational systems at nearly every level. And the church has
                    not been immune to our cynicism. We have even approached the bride of Christ
                    with wariness and uncertainty.</p>
                <p>All this fear i exacerbated, of course, by the Internet and the 24/7 news
                    cycle. Social media, in particular, amplifies our distrust and rewards our
                    outrage. As a result, many of us are less happy, less trusting, and more angry
                    than ever. Division and angst have become like oxygen. Over time, it can feel
                    like any remnant of hope might be slowly eroding, like a sandcastle at high
                    tide.</p>

                <h1>Painful Polarity in the Pews</h1>
                <p>As I said, the church has not been immune to the polarization. Congregations
                    have had to navigate higher levels of conflict, controversy, and
                    contentiousness. The pain of divisions in our pews is disheartening. Here we
                    are, the blood-bought people of God, united by Christ, but divided over so much
                    else. This state of affairs has some of us wishing we were still arguing over
                    whether to sing contemporary worship songs or what color carpet to lay in the
                    sanctuary.</p>
                <p>As a pastor of a church, a church I love to pastor, I would personally be
                    glad to never have to talk about COVID, vaccines, social distancing, and the
                    efficacy of masks ever again. While it was a privilege to shepherd our people
                    through a pandemic compounded by political and social turmoil, it was also
                    punishing at times. I’ve now added “global-health crisis,” “mass protests and
                    riots,” and “the threat of nuclear war” to my list of “things I never learned in
                    seminary.”</p>
                <p>It’s good to be reminded that polarization in the church is not new. In fact,
                    it’s a problem as old as the church. Already in Acts 6, the Greek-speaking Jews
                    complained that their widows were being neglected (Acts 6:1). Paul admonishes
                    another church for its divisions, quarreling, jealousy, and strife (1
                    Corinthians 1:10–11; 3:4). They found superiority in their allegiances to either
                    Paul, or Apollos, or Peter, forgetting that Christ is all in all.</p>
                <p>Again and again, through Scripture and church history, when sinful people
                    consistently gather, they consistently sin against one another and eventually
                    turn on one another.</p>

                <h1>Paradox of Christ</h1>
                <p>The writer of Hebrews tells us to cast off our sin that clings so closely,
                    and instead look to Jesus, “the founder and perfecter of our faith” (Hebrews
                    12:1–2). By looking to Jesus — and his paradoxical qualities — we find help to
                    navigate our polarized age.</p>
                <p>Jesus doesn’t fit into any of our neat and tidy categories or tribes. He is
                    pro-justice, pro-mercy, and pro-life. Jesus is gentle and lowly in heart, and he
                    also will return to make war against his enemies. He is the meekest man that
                    ever walked on earth, yet he will strike down the rebellious nations and tread
                    the winepress of God’s wrath (Revelation 19:11–15). He will save to the
                    uttermost with unparalleled grace and mercy, and he will rule with a rod of
                    iron.</p>

                <aside>
                    <p>“Jesus doesn’t fit into any of our neat and tidy categories or tribes.”</p>
                </aside>
                <p>Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758) draws out Jesus’s unique and paradoxical
                    qualities in a famous sermon: “The Excellency of Christ.” Jesus is both lion and
                    lamb. He possesses lionlike qualities: ferocious, powerful, regal, and
                    appropriately terrifying. He is full of power, glory, and dominion. A lamb is
                    quite the opposite: gentle, vulnerable, an animal of prey. How can Jesus be
                    both? How is he both judge of all creation and a friend of sinners? How is he
                    both priest and atoning sacrifice? How is he both strong and gentle, worthy and
                    lowly, infinitely holy yet merciful toward his enemies?</p>
                <p>This is the wonderful paradox of Jesus. He holds together seemingly opposite
                    excellencies in one God-man.</p>
            </article>
            <br>
            <article class="fourth-article">
                <h1>His Excellencies Undo Us</h1>
                <p>Typically, we gravitate to the ways Jesus is more like us; we align with
                    those excellencies more natural to our personality and wiring. Who he is,
                    however, admonishes us all to not be one-sided or one-dimensional. Jesus’s
                    example and teaching cuts both ways, admonishing us and encouraging each of us
                    to be more Christlike than we are.</p>
                <p>For example, tender believers may be quick to revel in the compassion of
                    Christ: “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
                    rest” (Matthew 11:28). They may resonate deeply with Jesus’s weeping outside
                    Lazarus’s tomb (John 11:35). Meanwhile, zealous-for-truth believers might admire
                    his woes to the Pharisees. They may resonate more with Jesus’s rebuke of Peter:
                    “Get behind me, Satan!” (Matthew 16:23).</p>
                <p>Those of us who are naturally inclined toward compassion and sympathy need to
                    learn from his courageous conviction. We need to beware of minimizing the whole
                    counsel of God to avoid hurting someone’s feelings or drawing harsh criticism.
                    We will want to unashamedly portray the truth of Christ accurately — all of it —
                    even as we comfort and care for hurting people. And we might be slow to condemn
                    those contending for truth in the public square who don’t do it exactly the way
                    we would. The gospel will necessarily offend some, and standing for truth in a
                    world set against the truth will require courage and boldness, and may even
                    appear quarrelsome in some eyes.</p>
                <p>The same is true for those who speak the truth more freely. Some of us are
                    quite gifted at saying the hard thing, but need to grow in doing so with love.
                    If we can speak with the tongues of men and angels, but have not love, we are
                    noisy gongs and clanging cymbals (1 Corinthians 13:1). We will pray for greater
                    compassion and sympathy, being quick to listen and weep with those who weep.
                    Proverbs reminds us, “A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up
                    anger” (Proverbs 15:1). Do our words, and the hearts behind those words,
                    consistently reflect the priorities of Christ? We want to become the kind of
                    paradox that we treasure and follow in Jesus.</p>
                <p>As you study him, watch where you lean and where you lean away, and then
                    deliberately lean into the diverse excellencies of Christ. Find courage in his
                    example. Where you are prone to wander, work to realign yourself more and more
                    to our North Star.</p>

                <h1>Truly Great Excellencies</h1>
                <p>Excellencies is an old-fashioned word meant to ascribe extreme value to
                    someone or something. Royalty would be addressed as “your Excellency.” For
                    Jesus, however, it’s not just a title, but a true and accurate description of
                    all that he is. He excels in his love and grace, in his compassion and justice,
                    in his rule and reign.</p>
                <p>Short of glory, we’re all in process. We’re finite. We’re sinners being
                    conformed to the image of Christ (Romans 8:29). Our instincts are being honed by
                    God’s word and the power of his Spirit. And as he conforms us to himself, our
                    glorious Savior — the Lion and the Lamb — lacks nothing. In every circumstance,
                    our paradoxical Savior speaks the perfect word. He never lacks compassion, and
                    he never shrinks back from a rebuke. He has no blind spots, weaknesses, or
                    deficiencies. He is all glorious in his diverse excellencies.</p>
                <aside>
                    <p>“Jesus has no blind spots, weaknesses, or deficiencies. He is all glorious in
                        his diverse excellencies.”</p>
                </aside>
                <p>Therefore, strive to think, feel, speak, and do more as Christ would in this
                    polarized world, and delight yourself in daily receiving his all-surpassing
                    glory and goodness.</p>
